# runner specifies a program that cargo automatically executes after compiling (using the 'cargo run' command).
# nust64 is used by default, to convert the generated ELF file into an N64 ROM, including the provided IPL3 binary.
# If you wish to use a different IPL3 file, just provide its path here, in place of the mini-ipl3.
# Cargo will append this command with the path to the ELF file, so make sure the command ends with '--elf'.
