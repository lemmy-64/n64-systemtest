# runner specifies a program that cargo automatically executes after compiling (using the 'cargo run' command).
# nust64 is used by default, to convert the generated ELF file into an N64 ROM. By default, it uses the open source
# ipl3_prod, which this testsuite requires.
# Cargo will append this command with the path to the ELF file, so make sure the command ends with '--elf'.
